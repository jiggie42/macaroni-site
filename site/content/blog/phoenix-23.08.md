**Finally, it's available the new `macaroni-security` repository!**

Considering that the Funtoo release 1.4-prime is in EOL, we will use
the `macaroni-security` repository to share security patches and
updates of Browsers, Devs tools, and other packages meantime we
rebooting Phoenix's branch to Funtoo Next.


Due to this change, **all users using Macaroni Phoenix MUST add
the `macaroni-security` repository before executing any update**.

```
$> luet repo update
$> luet i repository/macaroni-security
$> luet repo update
$> luet upgrade
```

The repository `macaroni-security` uses the new tree v2 which requires
luet version *0.37.0* or greather.

This repository is also a good example for the users about how could
create their repository starting from the Phoenix base layer and then
using *luet-build* and *luet-portage-converter* to generate their
packages.

# Macaroni OS enter on Docker-Sponsored Open Source Program

We are really happy to announce that we are entered into the annual
[*Docker-Sponsored Open Source Program*](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/dsos-program/).

The [`macaronios`](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/macaronios) docker user is now an organization.

We will complete the right setup in the next month.

Really, thanks to Docker Inc. for this opportunity.

# What next?

Hereinafter, out hot points in our backlog:

1. The refactor of `luet-build` go ahead and we will rename our
   PMS at the end of this refactor with the new name
   `anise`/`anise-build`.

2. Considering that the Funtoo release 1.4-prime will be in EOL
   for the end of the year we will move soon both Eagle and Phoenix
   release to the new tree. We will share for 3 or 4 months
   the repository `macaroni-phoenix-legacy` and `macaroni-eagle-legacy`
   to permit users using the 1.4-prime to manage a more quiet
   migration but without updates.

3. At the moment the `luet-portage-converter` doesn't manage
   for the same package multiple versions. When the refactor
   of `luet-build` will be ended we will review this feature to
   support multiple version in the same repository (for example,
   having multiple release of Nodejs package).
