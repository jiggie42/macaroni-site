The Docker Inc. approved the Macaroni OS to the
Docker-Sponsored Open Source program that permits
to remove the rate-limit for all users pulling
public images from our namespace.

The Macaroni OS Docker images are available on our
[`macaronios`](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/macaronios)
organization.

Thank you very much for your support.
