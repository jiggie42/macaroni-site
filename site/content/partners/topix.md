The TOP-IX Consortium has been actively working on several fronts: managing the Internet Exchange
infrastructure (the reason for its initial foundation in 2002); running the **Development Program**,
we are been added to this program; the Streaming platform, which has been providing support for
technological innovation projects since 2006; and the Streaming platform, which enabled the Consortium
to act as the official provider of the Berlinale Film Festival since 2006.

**The Consortium TOP-IX supplies a Development node that helps us with the building process
of the Macaroni packages.**

Thank you very much for your support.
